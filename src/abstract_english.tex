Recently, there has been an ever increasing growing interest in ' Networked Music Performances (NMP)', in which multiple performers perform music in real time over a network.
In NMPs there will always be a delay between the performers, which causes a phase shift in the music performance, causing a breakdown of the performance, which is a fatal problem for NMPs.
However, network delay is unavoidable when assuming a global performance over a network.
In this research, instead of reducing the latency in NMPs, I propose a system that allows performers to play music with each other regardless of the latency.
In doing so, I will discuss the underlying issues of latency in NMPs, introduce past research, and propose a system using music prediction to mitigate the effects of latency.
I have also conducted experiments to show that the proposed system can mitigate the effects of latency even in the presence of latency.
