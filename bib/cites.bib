  abstract  = {A Network Musical Performance (NMP) occurs when a group of musicians,  located at different physical locations, interact over a network to perform as they would if located in the same room. In this paper, we present a case for NMP as a practical Internet application, and describe a method to ameliorate the effect of late and lost packets on NMP. We describe an NMP system that embodies this concept, that combines several existing standards (MIDI, MPEG 4 Structured Audio, RTP/AVP, and SIP) with a new RTP packetization for MIDI performance. We analyze NMP experiments performed on CalREN2 hosts on the UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Caltech campuses.},

abstract="A Networked Music Performance (NMP) is defined as what happens when geographically displaced musicians interact together while connected via network. The first NMP experiments begun in the 1970s, however, only recently the development of network communication technologies has created the necessary infrastructure needed to successfully create an NMP. Moreover, the widespread adoption of network-based interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a renewed interest towards distant music-based interaction. In this chapter we present the Intelligent networked Music PERforMANce experiENCEs (IMPERMANENCE) as a comprehensive NMP framework that aims at creating a compelling performance experience for the musicians. In order to do this, we first develop the neTworkEd Music PErfoRmANCe rEsearch (TEMPERANCE) framework in order to understand which are the main needs of the participants in a NMP. Informed by these results we then develop IMPERMANENCE accordingly.",

abstract="Most people have no difficulty in picking out the beat in a piece of music, and even if they cannot define what it is they have detected, they can tap their feet in time with the music. This ability is called beat induction. A more difficult task, which we call rhythm recognition, involves uncovering the hierarchical structure of the timing relationships in the music, at a higher level than the frequencies of vibration of individual notes and chords, but at a lower level than the musical form and phrase structure. In this paper, we present a bottom-up approach to the recognition and transcription of musical rhythms from acoustic signals. We assume no a priori high-level knowledge of the music such as the time signature or tempo, but attempt to derive this information from the timing patterns of detected note onsets. The problem of rhythm recognition is divided into three stages: firstly, finding the main beat or rhythmic pulse of the music; secondly, discovering the rhythmic structure, a hierarchical arrangement of units consisting of multiples and submultiples of beats; and thirdly, mapping the note onsets to musical timings and durations. We compare our methods with other work presented in the literature and with commercial products which purport to solve the same problems. This work forms part of an automatic music transcription system currently under development by the author.",
